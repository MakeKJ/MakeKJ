# Hi, I’m Markus 👋

I’m interested in machine learning, AI, and scientific computing, especially projects where theory meets practical implementation.

Most of what you’ll find here are learning-driven and research-style projects: building models from scratch, experimenting with neural architectures, and creating end-to-end pipelines for data, training, and evaluation.

## Featured projects

- **ML library from scratch**  
  Traditional ML models and neural network layers implemented using low-level numerical operations to better understand optimization and model behavior.

- **Character-level Transformer**  
  A decoder-only Transformer trained to generate Harry Potter–style text.

- **Active learning for molecular potentials**  
  Scripts and workflows for training machine learning potentials with active learning.

- **Small side projects**  
  Including a simple Python-based Tetris game.

## Tools

- Python, C, SQL, R, Julia, MATLAB, Shell, Scala
- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Git, Linux
